Discworld author Terry Pratchett died at home today, after almost a decade of struggle with a rare and especially embuggering variant Alzheimer's disease called *posterior cortical atrophy*. As a memorial to one of the giants of modern fantasy, **The Black Sword** will attempt to compile a reasonably comprehensive set of resources about the late Mr. Pratchett and his works.

## Personal Memories

I have to admit that I'm not as conversant with his work, particularly his [**Discworld**](http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Main_Page) books. I haven't read most of them. The only ones I *recall* reading are some of the Rincewind books: *The Colour of Magic* and *Sourcery*. I enjoyed them, but other books and authors grabbed my attention. 

I'm currently reading *Night Watch*, though the graphic below, by [Krzysztof Kietzman](http://www.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/) from suggests I might have been better served by starting with *Guards! Guards!*.

![Discworld reading order guide by Krzysztof Kietzman](http://www.lspace.org/books/reading-order-guides/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-20.jpg "Discworld reading order guide by Krzysztof Kietzman")

As you can see, *Night Watch* is pretty far along. I blame [Rowan Cota](http://rowancota.com/) for mentioning it, but only a little.

Believe it or not, my *first* exposure to Discworld was the PlayStation port of the MS-DOS point-and-click adventure with voice acting by Monty Python's Eric Idle and the Third Doctor, John Pertwee.

Years later I went looking for more work by Neil Gaiman after reading *Sandman* and *American Gods*, and came across a little novel he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett called *Good Omens* in which a bungling Satanist nun switches the Antichrist at birth with a normal human child. The baby Antichrist, named Adam by his unsuspecting parents ends up telling Heaven and Hell alike to sod off -- which is absolutely *metal*.

It's because of *Good Omens* that I cared enough to tweet when I heard of Pratchett's death, and why I'm writing this post. I don't think Death ever said this in any of Pratchett's books, but I thought it would be his style.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIP?src=hash">#RIP</a> Terry Pratchett, 28 April 1948 - 12 March 2015. &quot;TO MAKE YOU WAIT ANY LONGER IS POINTLESS CRUELTY,&quot; said Death. <a href="http://t.co/84CI0c8VcN">http://t.co/84CI0c8VcN</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Graybosch (@MGraybosch) <a href="https://twitter.com/MGraybosch/status/576042949630377984">March 12, 2015</a></blockquote>

Terry Pratchett's official Twitter account had the following to say, as you may already know.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.</p>&mdash; Terry Pratchett (@terryandrob) <a href="https://twitter.com/terryandrob/status/576036599047258112">March 12, 2015</a></blockquote>

## Terry Pratchett: More Awesome Than I Realized

I might have read this before, but Terry Pratchett [*smelted his own iron, including some meteoric iron, and forged his own sword*](http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/blogs/sir-terry-pratchett-forges-a-sword-with-a-meteorite). That makes Pratchett [*metal*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metal&defid=2583515).
