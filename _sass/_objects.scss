/*
 * Objects. I’m a fan of object-oriented CSS, though I suppose you could remove this layer if you don’t use it. This layer is mostly layout-driven, and doesn’t include anything cosmetic. I included structural objects such as `.inner` and `.container` here, as well as some oft-repeated constructs such as `.post`s and `.hero`.
