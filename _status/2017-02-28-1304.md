When I was a kid, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were a punishment food, something you got stuck eating if you came to school without lunch money or a bagged lunch -- or had them stolen from you. Any kid seen eating PB&J at school when I was growing up was fair game for bullying.

I would go hungry at school rather than admit I didn't have lunch or money to buy lunch, but I don't mind eating PB&J sandwiches now because they're cheap and filling. They'd taste better without the memories, though.
