Individualism in America can kiss my dirty pinko atheist ass.

With that said: when I set out to do something, I do so with the knowledge that I might fail, or that success might not work out the way I thought it would when I started.

Twenty years ago, I started writing sci-fi. I wanted to publish a novel. I knew when I started that a metric shitload of people set out to write novels every year, and most of them never even finish a first draft.

I finished my first draft of my first novel in 2009. It was 289,000 words long, and called *Starbreaker*. It was such a piece of shit that to this day even my own wife hasn't read it straight through in its entirety. You might have heard of it.

Was there a payoff for my success in writing *Starbreaker*? Only in terms of what [Scott Barry Kaufman calls "authentic pride"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201207/pride-and-creativity).

There wasn't much payoff for writing my second and third novels, either. However, I succeeded in publishing them, most of the reviews were positive, and I even made some money in the process.

Do I blame myself for not being a bestselling author after publishing two novels through a small press? Individualism in America dictates that I should, but you might recall what I said about *that* bullshit.

Sure, I probably could have done a better job of marketing *Without Bloodshed* and *Silent Clarion*. I probably could have revised each of them a few more times, and polished them further, or made them less weird or more accessible to mainstream readers. If I had gone indie, or maybe published with one of the Big Five through an agent instead.

You can waste a *lot* of time playing "if only...", so much that it makes the average MMORPG-obsessed gamer look like a casual playing Angry Birds.

Rather than dwell on my failures, I prefer to focus on my modest successes: I've written three novels and published two before my fortieth birthday while working full-time as a software developer, my two published novels have mostly favorable reviews, and I have a small fan base who want more.

Maybe *Blackened Phoenix* or *Dead Man's Hand* or *Proscribed Constructs* or *Nightmare Sequencer* will be my breakthrough book. Maybe the last Starbreaker book I intend to write, *A Tyranny of Angels*, will be my breakthrough. Maybe I won't have my breakthrough until after I've finished writing Starbreaker stories and moved on to something with more mainstream appeal that didn't start out as a pastiche of JRPGs, John Carpenter sci-fi movies, 70s & 80s metal lyrics, and the Cthulhu Mythos.

Hell, maybe the breakthrough won't happen at all. Maybe I'll just have a hell of a lot of fun writing weird fucking books that hardly anybody reads about all-too-human androids and swashbuckling soprano catgirls exposing government corruption and fighting demons from outer space. Maybe I'll make just enough money off my books to take my wife out to dinner once in a while, and make a few friends at SF/fantasy conventions that I might not otherwise meet.

That doesn't seem like such a terrible fucking life to *me*, and since it's *my* life my opinion is the only one that actually matters. :)
