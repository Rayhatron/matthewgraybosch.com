I found this on Reddit a little while ago and thought, "hell yeah". So I decided to share it here with attribution and a link back to where I found it.

I'm probably wrong, but I think that Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Captain America is probably one of the only popular superheroes to have been explicitly conceived as an ardent anti-fascist, despite [pisodes of goose-stepping prompted by Marvel to goose sales](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/captain-america-fascist-hydra-marvel/).

Iron Man's no good. Sure, Tony Stark's trying to atone for starting rich and getting even richer as part of the military-industrial complex, but he's still a little too comfortable with authoritarianism.

What about Superman? Like Frank Miller wrote in *The Dark Knight Returns*, Clark Kent's a big blue Boy Scout willing to say yes to anybody in authority.

And let's not even get started on Batman. If Bruce Wayne was serious about cleaning up Gotham he'd kill the Joker and go after the *real* criminals: the ones who actually run shit.

Who else is there? The only other superhero I can think of who is anti-fascist at the conceptual level is probably Wonder Woman. [However, her anti-fascism is probably second to her feminism.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon) Which is probably as it should be...

If you can think of any other anti-fascist superheroes, link to this post and write your own blog post.
