This post was inspired by a [comment I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5q3u39/men_what_is_the_one_item_every_bachelor_should/dcwc7f6/) on Reddit in response to another user who asked, ["Men, What is the one item every Bachelor should have in their home to impress guests"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5q3u39/men_what_is_the_one_item_every_bachelor_should/).

Here are some things I had in my home that impressed guests when I was a bachelor. Keep in mind that this was over twenty years ago. The sort of people I wanted to impress might not necessarily be the same sort of people you want to entertain. What worked for me then might not work for you.

Most of my advice isn't suitable for intended for those pursuing a minimalist lifestyle. If you follow it, you probably won't be able to fit your possessions into your car, let alone your trunk. A careful bachelor might fit their stuff into a [small U-Haul](https://www.uhaul.com/Trucks/Cargo-Van-Rental/BE/). They might even get away with only making one trip.

## Advice for Bookish Bachelors

I'm a writer and a nerd, so it's only natural that my bachelor pad had shelves full of books. Furthermore, I had always been a bookworm as a kid. However, money was tight in my family so I had to either borrow from libraries books that my parents couldn't find at yard sales or in other people's garbage.

People used to give me grief as a kid for "living in a library", so I decided that was what I would do as a man. Having a couple of shelves in my living room with brand-new hardcover editions was a way to prove to myself that I was making something of myself, and a first step toward my dream of "living in a library".

I've even got a couple of library cats. Now I just need a card catalog.

### Your Non-Fiction Shelf

People will judge you by the books they see shelved in your living room. What they see can confirm their opinion of you, or give them cause to consider you in a different light. The books they see should reflect your own interests while reflecting favorably on you. 

To that end, you should have a shelf full of books from every subject in which you take an interest. You should choose books that you intend to revisit over the years and can use to spark intelligent conversation with guests, instead of something trendy that everybody who thinks they're somebody has but hasn't read. This means buying hardcovers, because trade paperbacks and mass-market paperbacks just aren't durable enough.

Though I suggested you select books that reflect your interest, it will reflect well on you if some of your books present viewpoints at odds with your own. The willingness and ability to read such books shows that you're secure enough in your own perspective to be capable of considering other perspectives. You will also be able to make a stronger case for your own viewpoint in conversation with others by understanding the other side.

Suppose I'm a guest in a devout Christian's home and I peruse their bookshelves. It would be a pleasant surprise indeed to flip through their copy of Richard Dawkins' *The God Delusion* and find marginalia indicating that they've read the book and considered Dawkins' viewpoint. Likewise, I've had unexpectedly interesting conversations with devout Christians because I've not only read the Bible but books like C. S. Lewis' *Mere Christianity* and considered their viewpoint.

It isn't for everybody, but having a shelf of hardcover books in your living room that you've read *for your own interest* can make you a more interesting person.

### Your Literature Shelf

Just as with your non-fiction shelf, your literature shelf should contain well-known and respected novels, collections of short stories, anthologies of poetry, and plays that reflect your personality in the most favorable possible light.

This doesn't mean your lit shelf must contain the sort of material you suffered through in your high school English classes. If you're the sort who only reads "true literature", by all means put towering novels of immortal genius here.

But even if your tastes aren't so rarified, you can use this shelf to store and display hardcover or leather-bound editions of classic works in your preferred genres. If you have limited editions, first editions, or copies signed by the author you should put them here, too.

## Advice for Musical Bachelors

The turn of the 21st century was both a good time to be a metalhead and a bad time. The good part was that while Amazon sold CDs you weren't likely to find in mass-market record stores like Tower Records, Sam Goody, or F.Y.E., most of the US still connected to the internet over dialup so digital music still consisted mainly of waiting half an hour to download 

If you're into music and you have a collection of albums on vinyl or CD, you'll probably want a good home stereo. Unfortunately the rise of digital music, especially digital streaming, has made it harder and more expensive to buy a good stereo system or build one from components. 

Hell, it was probably harder and more expensive twenty years ago than it was when my father was a young man in the middle of 1970s. Inflation sucks, doesn't it?

* A collection of CDs or vinyl in good condition. If you're inviting a woman over, you should have a few albums that aren't hip-hop, hard rock, heavy metal, or EDM unless you're dating somebody who's into that music, too. Take advantage of the existence of streaming music services and find some classical and jazz composers that appeal to you. Then buy some recordings.
* Framed reproductions of quality artwork. A band or movie poster won't magically become fine art if you frame it, but even a cheap frame is better than taping or tacking it to the wall. You don't have to do what I did and spend a weekend in a museum to figure out what you like, but a few well-chosen prints can make for excellent conversation.
* The tools, ingredients, and know-how to prepare meals for guests instead of picking up a phone and getting something delivered.
* A decent dinner service for 4-8 guests: plates, bowls, glassware, knives, forks, and spoons. There's not much point in preparing a nice meal if you're going to serve it on paper plates, unless it's summer barbecue.
* An [indoor herb garden](https://bonnieplants.com/library/how-to-grow-herbs-indoors/). If you're good with plants, herbs grown indoors are nice to cook with, and can make your place smell nice, too.
* A queen-size bed. You're going to want room for two (maybe even three). You might be tempted to go king, but I always thought that having a king-sized bed as a bachelor was just presumptuous.
* Two nightstands. One for you (to store condoms, lube, and other necessities) and one for her if she spends the night.
* Spare toothbrushes. If she decides on the spur of the moment to sleep with you, she probably won't have an overnight bag. She'll appreciate being able to brush her teeth the next morning without using your toothbrush.
* A small box of sanitary pads. Say you forgot an old girlfriend left them behind if you must, but I once had a guest whose period came unexpectedly early, and she was glad I had them handy.
* A friendly, confident, sociable cat. A house or an apartment just isn't a home without a cat, and a well-behaved cat who likes people can help make your guests feel welcome.
