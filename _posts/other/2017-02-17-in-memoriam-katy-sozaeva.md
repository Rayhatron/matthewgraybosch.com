I'm probably a jerk for not saying something sooner, but I'm sorry to know that [indie book blogger Katy Sozaeva](http://katysozaeva.blogspot.com/) lost her struggle against cancer. 2016 claimed far too many musicians that I grew up listening to with my father, but Ms. Sozaeva's death strikes a little closer to home.

I never met Ms. Sozaeva in person, and thus never had the opportunity to properly thank her for her kindness toward me. She was [one of the first to review my first novel](http://katysozaeva.blogspot.com/2013/12/mgraybosch-curiosityquills-review.html) ([Without Bloodshed](/stories/starbreaker/without-bloodshed/), published by [Curiosity Quills Press](https://curiosityquills.com)) way back in 2013. She was one of the first to publicly rave about it, and therefore one of my first fans.

I probably should have been more supportive toward her in her fight beyond offering her kind words when I saw her on social media, but it's too late now.

To Katy's friends and family, I offer my condolences. I'm honored that Katy not only read my first novel, but enjoyed it so.
