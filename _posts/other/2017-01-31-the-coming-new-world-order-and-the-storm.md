This new world order isn't about "one world government". It's about people, especially women, rising up and claiming as their due the natural human right to be fully human and realize their full potential.

It isn't inevitable, but short of a nuclear fucking holocaust there's little the regressives among us can do to stop it from happening.

## The Electric Prophet

[Nikola Tesla saw the new order coming, what Trump and his supporters are fighting so desperately to reverse](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/10/nikola-tesla-when-woman-is-boss/):

> It is clear to any trained observer, and even to the sociologically untrained, that a new attitude toward sex discrimination has come over the world through the centuries, receiving an abrupt stimulus just before and after the World War.

> This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.

> It is not in the shallow physical imitation of men that women will assert first their equality and later their superiority, but in the awakening of the intellect of women.

If that isn't enough, Tesla said the following, too:

> Through countless generations, from the very beginning, the social subservience of women resulted naturally in the partial atrophy or at least the hereditary suspension of mental qualities which we now know the female sex to be endowed with no less than men. But the female mind has demonstrated a capacity for all the mental acquirements and achievements of men, and as generations ensue that capacity will be expanded; the average woman will be as well educated as the average man, and then better educated, for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulated to an activity that will be all the more intense and powerful because of centuries of repose. Women will ignore precedent and startle civilization with their progress.

## The World is Moving On

Women have already startled civilization with their progress. And many people are not only startled, but they are scared out of their minds. Some men are terrified of the prospect of being surpassed by wives and daughters and discarded as useless. Some women are frightened of the prospect of being left behind and looked down upon by their sisters or daughters.

When you add the demands by black, Latinx, Asian, Muslim, agnostic/atheist, and LGBTQ people for basic recognition that they too are human beings and Americans with rights and the growing demands of workers for better pay and working conditions, it's no surprise that those already startled by the progress of women are pushed beyond reason.

Trump's victory in 2016, the continuing dominance of Republicans, Brexit, the resurgence of fascism, the rise of the alt-reich and neo-reactionary thought: these are all the reactions of people who know the world is about to move on without them. 

## The Storm Outside

Right now, the United States is full of angry, frightened people who feel like they've been left behind. They're right to feel that way thanks to decades of wage stagnation as the benefits of globalized capitalism went to the richest among us and failed to trickle down. The rising tide lifted the biggest ships, and sank far too many smaller craft.

And now, [the white working class that global capitalism left behind in "fly-over country" have claimed their revenge](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/donald-trump-election-hillary-clinton-election-night-inequality-republicans-trumpism). Our leaders, the self-styled best and brightest of us, insisted everything was getting better because things were getting better for *them*, and they didn't personally know anybody for whom life had gotten *worse*.

And they dare accuse *you* of living in a filter bubble because you use Facebook? Wealth and privilege are the ultimate filter bubbles.

Life kept getting worse for millions of Americans, and just like in Germany under the Weimar Republic, when people got angry enough and desperate enough, a demagogue showed up to tell them *exactly* what they wanted to hear. 

That demagogue is now the President of the United States. He has no idea what he's doing, his inner circle (Mike Pence, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon) are most likely using him, and he's not only too arrogant to admit he's in over his head, but too ignorant to realize it. By all means, be afraid. Fear is a rational response when confronted by utter insanity. 

## Here We Are Juggernaut

Be afraid. Get angry. Organize, resist, and fight.

But don't yield to despair. The old ways are dying. Those who cling to them probably know it deep down inside, but won't admit it even to themselves. Their rage is a storm, but storms _pass_.

When the storm passes, we will remain. We will rebuild. But in the meantime, let's find solidarity. Let's work together. Let's help each other ride out this storm, even if we can't abate its fury. The reactionaries' anger is a storm, but this is *our* world and *our* time. They had their chance. 

Together, we are a juggernaut. We have the power and the right to grind them and their false ideals into the dust of history. So, what are we waiting for?
