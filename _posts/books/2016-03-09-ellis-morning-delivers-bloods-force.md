I just bought _Blood's Force_ by [_The Daily WTF_](http://thedailywtf.com/) contributor [Ellis Morning](http://thedailywtf.com/authors/ellis-morning), because the blurb had a kind of _Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court_ vibe to it.

More details on Google+. [Or just buy it on Amazon for six bucks.](www.amazon.com/Bloods-Force-Sword-Starship-Book-ebook/dp/B015TUD5BG/)

## Update: 9 March 2015

This is an excellent little sci-fi tale with capable protagonists and constant tension throughout. My only disappointment was that Ms. Morning ended the story where she did; I want moar.
