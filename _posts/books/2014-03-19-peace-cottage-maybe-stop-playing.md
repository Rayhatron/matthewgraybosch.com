Maybe I should take a night off _Dark Souls II_, because the first thing that comes to mind after seeing the cover to Lisa Kent's upcoming inspirational/contemporary/women's fiction debut _Peace Cottage_ is, "Praise the Sun". The cover reminds me of how Majula might have looked before the kingdom of Drangleic fell apart.

Oh dear. I may have OD'ed. Sorry. ðŸ™‚<figure style="width: 419px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
