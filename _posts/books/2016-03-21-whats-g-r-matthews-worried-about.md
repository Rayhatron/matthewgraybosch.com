I'm not sure what [G. R. Matthews](http://www.grmatthews.com/#!Have-any-fans/cd3a/56edbcba0cf2420cfd6064a9) is worried about. He's better known than I am, with mentions on [Fantasy Faction](http://fantasy-faction.com/) and [SF Signal](http://sfsignal.com). He's also got three books out to my one.

And his experience with _The Stone Road_ parallels my experience with _Without Bloodshed_.

> The Stone Road came out to universal invisibility. A few picked it up, read it and I got some reviews. Go me! I didn’t expect much more and it was enough. Writing was fun and though The Stone Road has an ending, and you can leave it there (please don’t), I knew the story went on. 

But it wounds like he wishes he'd hear more from his readers.

> After all, you’d want to, wouldn’t you? The money is nice (would be nice, if I sold a hell of a lot more books), but talking to people who enjoy the fruits of all those hours spent hunched over a notebook, computer, research books (google and wiki these days) makes it all worthwhile. 

Welcome to my life, buddy. I wouldn't mind hearing more from _my_ fans. I know I've got a few; and I love 'em all like a cat loves its people. In the meantime, we authors just have to hang in there and keep writing. 

Seriously though, if you enjoyed our books, please take a few minutes to tell your friends about us. We need every bit of help we can get.
