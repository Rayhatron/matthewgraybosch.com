I use Oxford commas, and I'm not going to stop. You can take my Oxford comma when you pry it from the cold, dead hand that _isn't_ grasping a sledgehammer.

Hell, I use semicolons and archaic words and expressions when it's appropriate to do so. Why shouldn't I? I'm not going to refrain from using elements of the English language that others consider unfashionable or obtuse.

That's why I find [Debbie Ridpath Ohi's cartoon](http://inkygirl.com/inkygirl-main/2015/2/23/comic-taking-punctuation-personally.html) amusing.
