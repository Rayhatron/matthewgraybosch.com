Since Daniel Swensen had made a point of asking me what I thought of his debut fantasy _Orison_ after my [previous mention here](http://www.matthewgraybosch.com/2014/03/04/daniel-swensen-orison/ "Daniel Swensen: Orison"), I figured some rereading was in order. I tore through it this weekend, in between being summoned to help other _Dark Souls II_ players achieve victory through jolly cooperation. I didn't want to go back to working on Starbreaker stuff right after reading _Words of Radiance_.

_Orison_ is a short, fast-paced novel. At it's core, it's a crime caper. There's a MacGuffin, the titular orison, that the dragon Penumbra has put into play for reasons the novel eventually reveals. She offers it to Ashen One-Howl, a Warborn retainer to the Queen of Calushain, who quite sensibly refuses.

His sensible refusal turns out to be a mistake. Others get their hands on it, and scheme to place Wrynn and Dunnac, a wizard-turned-gambler and a swordsman exiled by different countries, in a position which forces them to obtain the orison and transport it.

The last piece of the puzzle lies in Story, a young burglar who manages to get her hands on the orison during a fight between Wrynn and Dunnac against Ashen One-Howl. The stakes rapidly escalate from here with Penumbra and an opposing dragon stirring the pot, leading to an explosive climax and a denouement that does a solid job of wrapping up the novel and leaving room for sequels despite its relative brevity.

I enjoyed _Orison_, and wouldn't mind seeing more in the Lotus Throne setting. I found Swenson's choice of "Penumbra" as a name for the dragon who set the novel's events in motion interesting. A <a title="Wikipedia: Umbra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra" target="_blank">penumbra</a> is a shadow cast by an object that partially occludes a light source, such as during a partial solar eclipse. I wonder if there's some significance there, or if Swensen chose that name for other reasons.
