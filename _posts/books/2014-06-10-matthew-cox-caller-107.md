I'm starting to suspect that Matthew Cox (_Division Zero_ and _Virtual Imm__ortality_) doesn't have a day job. How else is he gearing up to release his first YA title so soon after his last adult effort, _Virtual Immortality_? Maybe he just has a hell of a backlog. Either way, I'm happy to help him out, especially since he's a fan of mine.<figure id="attachment_724" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**When thirteen-year-old Natalie Rausch said she would die to meet DJ Crazy Todd, she did not mean to be literal.**

Two years is a long time to be stuck between two people that want nothing more than to destroy each other. A tween crush on the larger-than-life jock from a local radio station is the only trace of a once-happy life ruined by warring parents.

Whenever WROK 107 ran a contest, she would dive for the phone, getting busy signals and dead air every time. She never expected to get through, but at least with her best friend at her side, it used to be fun.

Before her parents ruined that too.

Her last desperate attempt to get their attention, falling in with a dangerous group of older teens, goes as wrong as possible. With no one left to blame for her mess of a life but herself, karma comes full circle and gives her just a few hours to make up for two years’ worth of mistakes–or be forever lost.<figure id="attachment_723" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
