I first read _The Devil You Know_ when <a title="K. H. Koehler Books" href="http://khkoehlerbooks.wordpress.com" target="_blank">K. H. Koehler</a> published it through Curiosity Quills Press. Now that she's gone indie again, she's taken the opportunity to re-issue the book with a new, stark, minimalistic cover.

I recommend it to fans of adult supernatural thrillers. It's how <a title="Hellblazer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer" target="_blank">Hellblazer</a> _should_ have been Americanized, assuming it was ever necessary to strip John Constantine of his Britishness.

This re-issued edition also includes her novelette _And Death Shall Have No Dominion_.

## Sympathy for the Devil

Not only does the devil have an only begotten son, but he's currently residing in the rural town of Blackwater in northeast Pennsylvania. Semi-retired from law enforcement, the handsome, if cynical, Nick Englebrecht becomes quickly caught up in a local missing child case that seems mundane on the outside, but when the sheriff requests his help as a psychic detective to help find the missing girl, his off-the-books investigation quickly leads him to some terrible truths about life, love and the universe as we know it. And if that isn't bad enough, the angels have begun an ethnic cleansing of all beings with demonic blood. Of course, Nick is at the top of their to-do list.
