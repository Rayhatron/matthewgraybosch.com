British SF author <a title="Ellie Garratt on Blogger" href="http://elliegarratt.blogspot.com">Ellie Garratt</a> was kind enough to <a title="An Interview With Romantic Science Fantasy Writer Matthew Graybosch " href="http://elliegarratt.blogspot.com/2014/03/an-interview-with-romantic-science.html" target="_blank">host me for her weekly interview today</a>. In addition to answering her questions, I treated her and her readers to a rough cut of the first scene in my current project, _The Blackened Phoenix_. Pay her a visit if you want to check it out and meet Dr. Josefine Malmgren.

Ellie is also the author of two collections of short stories, _Taking Time_ and _Passing Time_. The covers link to their respective Amazon pages if you want to help her out by buying copies.
