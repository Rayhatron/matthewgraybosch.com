I saw this screenshot of a tweet by [Tom Nichols](https://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Thomas-M--Nichols,-Ph-D-.aspx), national security expert, Naval War College professor, and _Jeopardy!_ Tournament of Champions winner on Reddit this afternoon, and it rubbed me the wrong way because I used to work in retail as a student.

If you're on a really slow connection, this image doesn't show up, or you don't feel like clicking the link above and going to Twitter, here's what Nichols said:

> Dear Every Cashier in America: the proper response to "thank you" is "you're welcome," not "no problem." And \*you're\* supposed to thank \*me\*.

When other Twitter users pushed back, he went on to write an article in [*The Federalist*](https://thefederalist.com) called "It's Not Oppression to Say 'Thank You'" in which he asked, ["When did the customer become the person in a transaction to say 'Thank you,' instead of the clerk?"](http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/21/its-not-oppression-to-say-thank-you/).

To answer this rhetorical question: the customer became the person to say "thank you" as soon as retailers started providing self-checkout systems. You're thanking the cashier, who happens to be a human being just like you, for the convenience of scanning your purchases for you, bagging them, processing your payment, giving you correct change if you paid cash. You should also say "thank you" when being served by a human being for not having to listen to a fucking robot say "unexpected item in bagging area" until you want to do to the self-checkout machine what Dave Bowman did to HAL-9000 in *2001: A Space Odyssey* after Bowman realized HAL had killed the rest of his crew and now intended to kill *him* too.

## Has Tom Nichols Ever Worked Retail?

When I was a student and had to serve customers directly instead of cleaning toilets or scraping baby barf off of supermarket floors, I said "thank you" to customers -- even customers like Dr. Nichols -- because my bosses asked it of me, it cost me additional little effort to do so, and I cared about doing my job well. I might have disliked not only the work, but the necessity of working, but I did it anyway, did it to the best of my ability, and kept my feelings to myself while I was on the clock.

However, as a customer I thank retail workers without begrudging them my thanks because despite working as a software developer and having a hand in several multi-million dollar projects for various state governments, I'd like to believe I'm not so arrogant as to think my work is more important than theirs even though I get paid several times more than they do and possess a sense of job security they are denied unless they work in a union shop.

I know how hard retail workers work because I've been one and I remember what it was like. Perhaps Dr. Nichols came from a more privileged background than mine and never had to scrub the walls of a supermarket toilet without so much as a pair of rubber gloves because a mentally ill homeless person mistook one of the walls for a canvas and their feces for fingerpaints. 

If so, I won't begrudge Nichols his good fortune. However, I find his attitude toward retail workers repugnant because of the class privilege from which I think it stems.

## Tom Nichols Is No Expert on Emotional Labor

Strictly speaking, though, he's right. Being obligated to say "thank you" to a customer isn't oppression. It's just [emotional labor](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/emotional-labor-womens-lives/), and in a just society where the market was more *humane* such emotional labor would be properly compensated. In such a society, emotional labor wouldn't be [a burden we disproportionately dump on women](http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/08/women-femmes-emotional-labor/) only to be shocked when they rebel against such unreasonable demands.

While most of the study of emotional labor rightly focuses on women, men must perform [unpaid emotional labor](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Labor-21st-Century-Perspectives-ebook/dp/B00CJFAZJK/) at work too. Men, like women, are expected to manage their emotions and keep up a certain appearance at work to please management and customers. Even workers who don't directly interact with customers, such as programmers like me, are expected to do unpaid emotional labor.

It's just that men get to stop doing emotional labor once they leave the workplace. Women are still stuck doing it at home, as well as on the job. 

Take writing birthday cards, for example. I should have written the birthday card Catherine and I gave my mother yesterday because it's *my* mother's birthday (not hers), but I've always let Catherine do it just because her handwriting is better than mine and she also adds cute little cat doodles.

Maybe I should suck it up and ask Catherine if she *minds* writing the cards, but I'm too chickenshit to do so. Questions have consequences; I might not like the answers I get.

## So What if Tom Nichols Apparently Holds Retail Workers in Contempt?

I'm tempted to just say "What an asshole!" and go on with my life, but I recently read Tom Nichols' most recent book, *The Death of Expertise* and found it interesting and well-reasoned, though ultimately unconvincing. 

Furthermore, though he's a conservative and I'm a student of Objectivism who became some kind of libertarian socialist because I couldn't make my Starbreaker setting a convincing and intellectually consistent right-libertarian utopia, it turns out that [most of his reasons for opposing Donald Trump by supporting Hillary Clinton were also mine](https://storify.com/dankennedy_nu/a-conservative-s-nevertrump-tweetstorm).

I say most because while Dr. Nichols was willingly to obliquely refer to a certain alt-reich propagandist, I refused to let that person or his antics figure into my own reasons for opposing Trump. 

Trump is easily one of the worst Presidents to have ever sat in the Oval Office even though he hasn't even served his first hundred days, but he would be a terrible President with or without the Breibart Brownshirts riding his coattails. Actually, if Trump didn't have Steve Bannon pulling his strings, he might not be so dangerous because it would be easier to *contain* him. 

If he had a VP who wasn't Mike Pence (a Christian dominionist, a misogynist, and probably a closet case), then all we'd have to do is keep him focused on Twitter while actual *professionals* run the executive branch unless Congress passes a bill that requires his signature/veto. However, that would require a VP who understood the Constitution and was steadfastly loyal to its principles. 

You won't find such people in the Republican Party. They might pay as much lip service to the Constitution as they do to the teachings of Jesus, but they don't actually *care* about upholding liberty and equal justice under law for all any more than they actually *care* about being Christlike and caring for the sick, the poor, the foreigners, and the outcasts among us.

## Wait. When Did This Become a Post About the Orange Shitgibbon? 

Don't worry. This post isn't about Donald Trump, his Breitbart Brownshirt cronies, *or* the Republicans. It's about Tom Nichols. I just went off on a tangent because he [continues to serve as part of the loyal (to America) opposition to the Republican administration, and appears to be a voice of reason.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/02/trump-outrage/?utm_term=.77206fec6686). 

While I despise the attitude toward retail workers he displays by presuming to instruct them on how to speak English and his expectation that they think *him* for the alleged privilege of ringing up his groceries, I still respect him for his public service and his academic work.

Incidentally, I owe Dan Kennedy at Media Nation a shout-out for linking to Nichols' storified tweets and *Washington Post* op-ed in his 02/06/2017 post, ["Some calming thoughts on Trump coverage from a #NeverTrump conservative"](https://dankennedy.net/2017/02/06/some-calming-thoughts-on-trump-coverage-from-a-nevertrump-conservative/).

I might think the man's attitude toward retail workers is contemptible, but because I respect his position and accomplishments I'm going to take the high ground here and address Nichols as "Dr. Nichols" in the rest of this post.

You see, Dr. Nichols' 2015 tweet is almost as amusing as it is classist and offensive, because he is presuming expertise in how the English language should be spoken and I don't think he so much in majored in either English or linguistics as an undergrad at Boston University, and his postgrad work has nothing to do with either of these disciplines. Rather, his expertise is in social science and public policy.

Despite presenting his opinion on the correct way to respond to "thank you" as if it were fact, Dr. Nichols decries the very behavior of which he was guilty in his most recent book, *The Death of Expertise* (which was originally [an article published on *The Federalist*](http://thefederalist.com/2014/01/17/the-death-of-expertise/). 

> People are now exposed to more information than ever before, provided both by technology and by increasing access to every level of education. These societal gains, however, have also helped fuel a surge in narcissistic and misguided intellectual egalitarianism that has crippled informed debates on any number of issues. Today, everyone knows everything: with only a quick trip through WebMD or Wikipedia, average citizens believe themselves to be on an equal intellectual footing with doctors and diplomats. All voices, even the most ridiculous, demand to be taken with equal seriousness, and any claim to the contrary is dismissed as undemocratic elitism.

> As Tom Nichols shows in *The Death of Expertise*, this rejection of experts has occurred for many reasons, including the openness of the internet, the emergence of a customer satisfaction model in higher education, and the transformation of the news industry into a 24-hour entertainment machine. Paradoxically, the increasingly democratic dissemination of information, rather than producing an educated public, has instead created an army of ill-informed and angry citizens who denounce intellectual achievement.

> Nichols has deeper concerns than the current rejection of expertise and learning, noting that when ordinary citizens believe that no one knows more than anyone else, democratic institutions themselves are in danger of falling either to populism or to technocracy-or in the worst case, a combination of both. The Death of Expertise is not only an exploration of a dangerous phenomenon but also a warning about the stability and survival of modern democracy in the Information Age.

## What I Thought of *The Death of Expertise*

I think Dr. Nichols presents in both his article and his book a well-reasoned case for deference to expertise, but despite his efforts I do not find his argument compelling. 

If I wanted to not only be uncharitable but engage in ad hominem attacks, I might rephrase the central premise of *The Death of Expertise* as an impassioned *cri de couer* to a general public that is frequently guilty of willful ignorance and proud anti-intellectualism.

> "Waaaah! I'm an expert on a particular subject, but ordinary people don't take my opinions as seriously as I think they should!"  
> <cite>&mdash; the TL;DR version of *The Death of Expertise* by Tom Nichols</cite>

Dr. Nichols seems to understand that opinions are just like assholes. We all got 'em, and the vast majority of 'em stink. His problem is that he thinks his own asshole never stinks, but instead smells like roses and is always a virginal pink. 

He also doesn't seem to understand that an expert is just as capable of being *wrong* as anybody else about matters within their expertise, though they might be less likely to be wrong.

Moreover, Dr. Nichols is guilty of a particular sort of intellectual arrogance common to engineers and computer science types. To quote:

> Most engineers are as sensible and reasonable as anyone, but engineers as a group have a noted tendency to pontificate on things well outside their area of expertise, to the point of actual fallacy.  
> <cite>&mdash;[RationalWiki: "Engineers and woo"](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Engineers_and_woo)</cite>

## Why Is Dr. Nichols Afraid of Other People's Opinions?

You'd think I'd be sympathetic, since as a programmer I get to deal with non-programmers questioning my judgment about how best to implement a feature or business requirement, but you know what? Maybe a certain sort of intellectual humility is part of my small repertoire of virtues, despite my usual insistence to the contrary.

I've learned over the years that though I'm a damned good programmer, I don't know everything and never will even if I were put everything else aside and became one of those obsessive nerds who live, breathe, eat, drink, piss, and shit programming. I'm just not willing to go to such lengths to be some kind of legendary god of coders whose professional judgment is beyond question.

Because I don't know everything, anybody willing to challenge me and say, "Are you sure that's the best way to go about this?" is doing me a *favor*. By questioning my judgment, they have challenged me to *convince them* that I was right. To do so, I must marshal my knowledge, get my facts straight, and present a clear case in language they can understand.

The necessity of researching and presenting a clear and well-reasoned argument for my preferred solution to a given software development problem gives me the opportunity to not only reinforce my knowledge of whatever technology I'm currently using, but lets me practice other skills such as research, inductive and deductive logic, and informative and persuasive writing or speaking.

Admittedly, as a programmer who posts about all sorts of shit that isn't programming (like this post right here) I'm often guilty of this myself. However, I don't have the platform Tom Nichols does, nor am I a professor at the Naval War College.

Tom Nichols should have known better than to post this, and he should have been able to predict the reaction he got. If he can't, then perhaps he should stick to his acknowledged areas of competence instead of presuming to tell retail workers how to speak "proper English".
