I haven't even finished my bachelors' degree, and have no intention of doing so. If today's coding boot camps were available in 1996, I probably wouldn't have bothered to go to college at all. 

It might not be the case outside the US, but I've come to think of school as a racket. You'll spend your childhood and early adulthood busting your ass in school, and others will profit at *your* expense. You might get some credentials in the end, but others will have made tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars off of your labors.

Unless you want to read a rant in which I elaborate on **why** school is a racket, you should stop reading now.

**K-12 schooling is a racket.** Kids are compelled by law to attend, don't get a say in which school they attend, and are not legally permitted to opt out until they're 16. That makes them a captive audience for the standardized testing industry that started becoming cancerous in the 1990s as they began to profit from the "Standards & Accountability Movement". 

The teachers might still give a shit, and they might push back against demands from politicians for "accountability" via standardized tests created and administered by for-profit corporations, but everybody above the teachers in the hierarchy is turning a profit somehow. They either get cushy salaries, or they get to charge school districts (which are mainly supported by municipal property taxes) millions of dollars to provide and administer the tests. 

School used to be about taking boys and girls and turning most of them into obedient, punctual workers who wouldn't inconvenience their betters by organizing, going on strike, or refusing to buy shit they don't need or actually want. Now it's also about turning a profit off the task of grading students so that they and their parents know just how worthless they are.

When you finally get out of high school, your diploma isn't even worth using as toilet paper. Why? Follow the money. Even privately-owned ["charter schools" run for profit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/28/separating-fact-from-fiction-in-21-claims-about-charter-schools/) can't get away with charging students for books, supplies, and fees yet. If parents came home from work to see a bill in the mail for their first grader's reading primers, you would see a public outcry that makes the protests against Donald Trump's election and inauguration as President look like grumbling in the back of a high school study hall.

**The real money is in undergrad schooling.** College is an even bigger racket because we've drilled into kids' heads the notion that skilled trades are beneath them, and the only way to get a "good job" (one that isn't in food service or retail) is to go to college. It's OK if you can't afford to go to college because your parents aren't rich, didn't invest enough in your college fund, or your college fund got deflated by a recent stock market crash. Just sign yourself into indentured servitude by taking out student loans that you must repay even if you quit school or can't get a job with your degree because you can't discharge them under a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding [unless you file a separate Complaint to Determine Dischargeability and can prove your student loan debt creates "undue hardship"](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-bankruptcy-discharge/).

In the meantime, colleges keep jacking up tuition every year. Even state universities charge residents as much today as private colleges did 10-20 years ago. They do it because they can. They know that one way or another the kids will pony up. The kids **will** shell out, signing over the next decade or two of their lives. They'll regret it later, but they'll do it anyway. 

The kids will sign themselves into indentured servitude, working shit jobs that crush their souls to pay off their loans. They'll hate themselves for it, but they'll do it because they don't think they have a better option. They'll think that because nobody ever told them skilled trades were an option, they think any work that isn't done in an office is beneath them, and they've been told all their lives that success means having as impressive a job and as high a salary as possible.

Never mind that nobody ever gets rich working for wages or a salary. Not only do you not get paid enough, but the tax code is rigged to punish workers by taxing wages/salaries more heavily than dividends and other capital gains. 

But that's a subject for another rant. Back to school. If you thought undergrad was bad, just wait. It just gets worse.

**Post-grad education is also a racket.** If all you want is a masters' degree, you're going to just keep paying. But if you're after a doctorate, or you want to become a physician or an attorney, then you're in for some real fun.

You know how I said you won't get rich working a white-collar job and drawing a salary? Well, you'll be lucky if you can afford a diet that isn't mostly ramen or rice and beans while working on your doctorate. Sure, the university might give you a stipend, but instead of working on your own project you'll be doing some professor's scut work: teaching, grading, and doing research on the professor's behalf instead of your own so they can write another paper where you might get a mention in the acknowledgements section but almost never credit as a co-author.

**Law school is also a racket.** If you want to become a lawyer in the US, you've got to bust your ass in high school and undergrad. Then you've got to bust your ass to prep for the LSAT (Law School Admissions Test) and apply at various law schools, and naturally you'll want to study at the most prestigious law school that will admit you because that will help you get work at more prestigious law firms once you finally pass the bar exam.

Oh, and if you think CS majors are nerds, just wait until you get into law school. Welcome to three years of nothing but law. You will live, breath, eat, drink, piss and shit nothing but law, and you'll be paying for the privilege the whole time. 

Don't even think about working while going to law school, especially your first year. Hell, don't even think about spending a lazy Sunday morning in bed jerking off. You won't have the time. You probably won't have the energy, either, and thinking about the student loans you've racked up along the way will probably be a total boner-kill anyway. Depending on where you did your undergrad study and where you went to law school, you could end up owing a quarter million dollars.

Assuming you survive law school, you'll still be expected to do unpaid internships or work as a clerk while preparing for the bar exam. And once you've passed the bar and are licensed to practice, any firm you join will only value you according to the hours you bill.

**But doctors make good money, don't they?** You'd think doctors would make good money, given that after they finish their pre-med undergrad program they must pass the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test), get through medical school, complete their residency and internship, get licensed to practice, and become board-certified.

[The author of this Quartz article may be an outlier](https://qz.com/67304/i-just-finished-my-87-hour-work-week-and-have-230000-in-medical-school-debt/), but he claims to work 30 hour shifts, 80+ hour weeks, and owes $230,000 in debt. Depending on your specialty and where you practice, [you could pay between $3,000 and $35,000 a year for medical malpractice insurance](http://truecostofhealthcare.net/malpractice/).

While it's admirable that young men and women want to make something of themselves, the US has a host of industries that exist for no higher purpose than to monetize youthful ambition regardless of the human cost. If you go to college, you'll be opening yourself up to predatory lenders, predatory schools, and a predatory workplace.

Learn a trade instead. You might still get fucked in the ass, but at least people working skilled trades can look out for themselves and each other as union members.
