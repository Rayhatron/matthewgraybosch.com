Over twenty years in the making, Starbreaker is a heavy metal science fantasy epic set in a twisted mirror image of our own world's near future.

## About Starbreaker

After a collapse remembered by the survivors as Nationfall, humanity rebuilt their civilization and sparked a Second Renaissance. The resurgent human population lives and works with human-level artificial intelligence, settlements on Luna and Mars debate whether and how to preserve the landing sites of pre-Nationfall spacecraft, and an elite corps of Adversaries watch over church, state, and commerce to root out corruption and abuses of power.

However, a millennia-old conspiracy uses subterfuge and magic to maintain its control of the world. A threat to humanity’s survival and that of a race which lived among humanity since the dawn of human civilization waits to break free of its underground prison. The person best suited to face this threat doesn’t know he’s not human, but a sentient bioweapon.

## Inspired by Heavy Metal

I wasn't kidding when I said Starbreaker was inspired by heavy metal. If you have a Spotify account, or don't mind making one, you can hear some of the songs that inspired the characters and story of Starbreaker over the last twenty years.

## A Little Taste

Want a little taste of Starbreaker? Try these quotes from various stories.

### Morgan in *Without Bloodshed*

> You're right, Naomi. I *am* tired. When reasonable Adversaries like you fail, the Society turns to unreasonable ones like me. When diplomats fail, the Society speaks of necessary evils and resorts to killers. I'm tired of being a necessary evil.

### Naomi in *Silent Clarion*

> Surrendering my cardigan to the cat after indulging in a belly rub, I decided on my favorite leather jacket instead. I had found it in a secondhand shop, still supple and gleaming despite its age. It had zippers enough to set off metal detectors, and let me look at myself in the mirror and feel a touch Byronic. Sometimes I just wanted to be 'mad, bad, and dangerous to know'.

### Tetsuo in *Without Bloodshed*

> The Shenzhen labor strike was engineered. Isaac Magnin and the rest of the Executive Council have their hands in everything: corporations, organized labor, organized religion, and even organized crime. It's all a revenue stream for those bastards, and while they leave sole proprietors and co-ops alone, businesses are extorted of half their profits. Anybody who doesn't pay up finds their workforce on strike. If they still haven't fallen in line after the strike, we get sent in to make sure they pay up&mdash;or die.

## The Cast

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/fullsize/starbreaker-cast-collage.jpg" alt="character portrait collage" caption="Some of the cast of Starbreaker. Commissioned artwork by Harvey Bunda." %}

Taken from the design works for *Blackened Phoenix*, this is a list of major characters in the Starbreaker saga grouped by organization, faction, or type. It is not exhaustive, and might contain spoilers.

 * Annelise Copeland - a rising New York fashion designer with her own boutique on Fifth Avenue. Bears a striking resemblance to the late Christabel Crowley.
 * Sabaoth - an ensof imprisoned beneath the Antarctic ice cap by Imaginos. Frequently appears before humans, claims to be God, and demands humans obey his commands to commit genocide.
 * Mordred - A rakshasa who has adopted Morgan Stormrider and his companions. Can understand English, but his spoken vocabulary is limited to "meow".

### Crowley's Thoth

Crowley's Thoth is a neo-Romantic heavy metal band active between 2101 and 2112. Noted for albums like *Prometheus Unbound*, *Glass Earth Falling*, and *Water Margin*; Crowley's Thoth is also famous for its three-hour live shows, which often start without the band's founder and violinist.

* Christabel Crowley (deceased?) - Violin/Viola
* Morgan Stormrider - Guitar/Vocals
* Naomi Bradleigh - Lead Vocals/Keyboards

### The Phoenix Society

The Phoenix Society is nominally a non-government organization dedicated to the defense of free and open societies through active policing of corruption and abuses of power in government, commerce, and religion. The truth is a bit more sinister.

#### Adversaries

Adversaries are agents of the Phoenix Society's enforcement arm, the **Individual Rights Defense** corps. If Solid Snake from *Metal Gear Solid* worked for the ACLU, he'd be similar to what Adversaries are supposed to be.

 * Morgan Stormrider
 * Naomi Bradleigh
 * Edmund Cohen
 * Sid Schneider
 * Sarah Kohlrynn
 * Catherine Gatto

#### IRD Corps Directors

Though the AIs comprising the Sephiroth do most of the work of assigning work to Adversaries, human officers have the final say.

* Saul Rosenbaum
* Iris Deschat
* Karen Del Rio

#### The Sephiroth

Ten artificial intelligences govern most aspects of the Phoenix Society's operations, but serve other purposes and have their own agenda.

* Malkuth
* Kether
* Gevurah
* Binah
* Tiphareth

#### The Executive Council

The identity of the Phoenix Council's executive council is a carefull-guarded secret to keep the Society's enemies from striking at the Society's heart -- and to preserve the secret of the Society's true nature and purpose.

* Isaac Magnin
* Charles Desdinova
* Edmund Cohen
* Tamara Gellion
* Elisabeth Bathory
* Samuel Terell
* Abram Mellech

### Port Royal

A distributed digital republic composed primarily of techies, hackers, crackers, gamers, and trolls. Port Royal is a frequent source of anti-Phoenix Society sentiment, and occasional attacks against the Society's technical infrastructure.

* Claire Ashecroft - a gray-hat hacker who frequently works with Morgan Stormrider and his crew

### The AsgarTech Corporation

The Asgard Technological Development Corporation (AsgarTech) is one with a long and unsavory history spanning four incarnations. The most recent under Isaac Magnin is responsible for the Asura Emulator Project and primarily funded by the Phoenix Society &mdash; but this is a closely guarded secret.

* Isaac Magnin, CEO
* Dr. Josefine Malmgren, ÆsirOS developer/Project Æsir (Asura Emulator Project)
* Polaris, Project Æsir prototype

### Ohrmazd Medical group

Ostensibly a benevolent organization specializing in providing bleeding-edge medical care to the masses, Ohrmazd Medical is also involved in the Asura Emulator Project.

* Dr. Charles Desdinova, Founder

### Disciples of the Watch

A cabal of ensof sworn to guard the Starbreaker, the Disciples are likewise sworn to destroy any ensof who threatens sapient species under their protection, like devas/asuras and humans.

* Thagirion
* Ashtoreth
* Sathariel
* Adramelech (cast out for treachery)
* Imaginos

### Nakajima Armaments of Kyoto

A manufacturer of arms and armor trusted by Adversaries since its foundation in 2071 by Nakajima Kaoru, it continues to supply Adversaries under the supervision of Kaoru's daughter Chihiro, who took over the company in 2104.

* Nakajima Kaoru (deceased), - Founder
* Nakajima Chihiro, President
* Ms. Yamagishi, administrative assistant to Nakajima Chihiro
* Masamune, Design and Production AI for Nakajima Armaments

### Murdoch Defense Industries

A manufacturer of cheap equipment propped up by the Phoenix Society, Murdoch also makes additional profits by selling black-market arms &mdash; with the Society's tacit approval.

* Victoria Murdoch, CEO
* Don Kissel, factory foreman

### MEPOL

Though Adversaries have had to clamp down on abuses committed by officers of the Metropolitan Police of London, the modern MEPOL is an efficient, professional police force.

* Chief Inspector Gregory Windsor

### Blackened Phoenix

This opposition group sprang into prominence in the wake of the Phoenix Society's counterrevolutionary operations in Boston. Initially demanding "justice for Liebenthal" through social media activity and non-violent demonstrations outside Society installations, Blackened Phoenix has recently resorted to attacking the Society's Technological infrastructure.

* Munakata Tetsuo
* Alexander Liebenthal
* Vincent Rubicante
* Sarah Kohlrynn

### Household AIs

Digital butlers/secretaries serving private individuals are slowly becoming more common as costs decrease, but remain expensive because AIs are considered persons under the law, and are therefore protected by the Universal Declaration of Individual Rights.

* Astarte (works with Morgan)
* Hal (works with Claire)
* Wolfgang (works with Naomi)
* Aleister (worked with Christabel)
* Savannah (works with Eddie)
* Howl (works with Josefine)
