Why do I write? Here are some simple reasons.

* **I do it because I can.**
* **I do it because I want to.**
* **I do it because I *choose* to.**

These are the only reasons I need, but I could come up with others if necessary.

The fundamental truth is that the stories I wanted to see told went untold, and I wasn't satisfied with what I reading. Rather than bitch about it, I decided to sit my ass down and *do* something about it.

What, were you expecting a manifesto?
