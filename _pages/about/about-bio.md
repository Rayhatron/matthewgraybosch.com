# Bio

According to official records maintained by the state of New York, Matthew Graybosch was born on Long Island in 1978.

Urban legends suggest he might be Rosemary’s Baby or the result of top-secret DOD attempts to continue Nazi experiments combining human technology and black magic. The most outlandish tale suggests that he sprang fully grown from his father’s forehead with a sledgehammer in one hand and the second edition of *The C Programming Language* in the other&mdash;and has been giving the poor man headaches ever since.

The truth is more prosaic. Matthew Graybosch is an author from New York who lives with his wife and cats in central Pennsylvania. He is also an avid reader, a long-haired metalhead, and an unrepentant nerd.

*Without Bloodshed* (2013) is his first published novel, and followed by *Silent Clarion* in 2016. He is working on *Blackened Phoenix*. He has also written short stories like "The Milgram Battery", "Limited Liability", and "Tattoo Vampire".

His day job is software development, and we're not sure how he remains sane. We could ask, but we suspect he’d say, "I'm not sane. I’m high-functioning."
