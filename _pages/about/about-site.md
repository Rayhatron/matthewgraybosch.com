This site is basically my soapbox and an advertisement for me and my work. It's built using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) kit by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/) with tweaks by yours truly.

I purchased the matthewgraybosch.com domain around 2011, and have run various versions of a website using CMS tools like WordPress and Ghost. At one point I even had the domain pointing to Squarespace, and had built a pretty snazzy site -- only to find out that their UI for writing blog posts left *much* to be desired.

Rather than continue to use blogging software that stuffs everything into a database and forces me to use shitty browser-based editors to write, I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It lets me store my content as Markdown-formatted plain text. 

Most of the images I use live on [Imgur](http://imgur.com/). All the code and text for this site lives on [Github](https://github.com/matthewgraybosch/jekyll-matthewgrayboschdotcom). I use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for automatic builds. I've been testing the site on [Surge](http://surge.sh). I might move my domain over instead of going back to [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com).

Is this shit complicated for a writer? Yeah. Good thing I'm not just a writer. Sure, I could just blog on [Medium](http://medium.com), but I'd rather have a site of my own. If you'd like a site like this one, [get in touch](/contact/).
