# How I Started Writing

Twenty years ago I had a problem. I had no idea what the hell I was going to do with my life, but I knew I wanted to do more than earn a paycheck, pay bills, and scrape together some spare cash every month so I could buy another heavy metal album.

I was eighteen, and realized I'd never be worth a damn as a musician. Lacking anything better to do, and needing a more constructive pastime than trying and failing to get laid, I said to my cat, "Screw it, I'll write a goddamn novel." 

Which I did, and it sucked so hard that Stephen Hawking wrote a paper about it. The next one wasn't that great, either. Or the one after that.

It wasn't until 2009 that I completed a novel that was halfway decent, a monstrosity called Starbreaker. I spent the next two years refining it until getting the attention of Curiosity Quills Press and agreeing to publish Starbreaker as a series. In 2013 I published the first Starbreaker novel, Without Bloodshed.

Join me on my continuing quest to write badass science fantasy inspired by heavy metal and progressive rock. It's gonna be loud.
