You should never, *ever* see this page unless one of my cats managed to fly to California, sneak into Dreamhost's data center, and barf all over the server.

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/resized/technical-difficulties.jpg" alt="old TV technical difficulties screen" caption="Please be patient. We'll get this fixed ASAP." %}

In the meantime, one of these pages might still work. I apologize for the inconvenience.
