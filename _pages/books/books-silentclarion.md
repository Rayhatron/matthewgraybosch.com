# Silent Clarion

I honestly never meant to write a prequel to [*Without Bloodshed*](/stories/starbreaker/without-bloodshed/) featuring Naomi as a young Adversary. I didn't mean to write it as a sixty-six chapter web serial that became a six-part Kindle serial before finally appearing as a novel. And I most certainly didn't mean to focus exclusively on this story at the expense of [*Blackened Phoenix*](/stories/starbreaker/blackened-phoenix/).

It was just supposed to be an expansion of  a little novelette called ["Steadfast"](/stories/starbreaker/steadfast/) that I had written for [Curiosity Quills Press](https://www.curiosityquills.com). It didn't work out that way.

## No Rest for the Wicked

Naomi Bradleigh needed some time away from her duties as an Adversary sworn to the Phoenix Society. She wasn't going to get much.

## How to Purchase

*Silent Clarion* is currently only available as a Kindle eBook. I will provide updates on the print edition as soon as information is available, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

If you have Kindle Universe, you can read it for free. If you don't have KU, and you're strapped for cash, you can buy the first part separately.

## The Post-Breakup Working Vacation from Hell

My curiosity might get me killed.

I thought I needed a vacation from my duties as an Adversary in service to the Phoenix Society. After learning about unexplained disappearances in a little town called Clarion, I couldn't stop myself from checking it out.

Now I must protect a witness to two murders without any protection but my sword. I must identify a murderer who strikes from the shadows. I must expose secrets the Phoenix Society’s executive council is hellbent on keeping buried.

I have no support but an ally I dare not trust. If I cannot break the silence hiding what happened in Clarion’s past, I have no future.

I must discover the truth about Project Harker. Failure is not an option.

## More Info

*Silent Clarion* is a new-adult science-fiction thriller by Matthew Graybosch, set before the events of the Starbreaker novels. Meet Naomi Bradleigh as an Adversary, seventeen years before *Without Bloodshed*.

Published by Curiosity Quills Press and edited by Matthew Cox.

## Featured Review

> Graybosch creates an interesting world of light-handed and benevolent totalitarian rule against the background of a world that has rebuilt itself after a global collapse. This allows Artificial Intelligences and cutting-edge technology to sit comfortably next to ubiquitous mêlée combat and secrets hidden in the backwoods.
