# Without Bloodshed

When I first began rewriting my 2009 draft of Starbreaker for [Curiosity Quills Press](https://curiosityquills.com) and sending them copy, the editor came back to me and said something like, "This is way too big. Can we make it a trilogy or a series?"

I replied fifteen minutes later with a list of four titles. This is the first of them.

## Nolo contendere

Morgan must prove he isn't the Phoenix Society's assassin as conspiracies envelop him and his friends, but how can he refute the naked truth?

## How to Purchase

It's easy to get a copy of *Without Bloodshed*. Just buy the [Kindle](href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GQ0BJOO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GQ0BJOO&linkCode=as2&tag=starbreaker-20&linkId=c696333fe35794b952311064350ca847) or [paperback edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1620072793/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=starbreaker-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1620072793&linkId=49f7c17f7bacc3787e715f7487c0c7fd) on Amazon, or ask for the paperback at your favorite bookstore.

## "All who threaten me die."

These words made Morgan's reputation as one of the Phoenix Society’s deadliest IRD officers. He served with distinction as the Society’s avenger, hunting down anybody who dared kill an Adversary in the line of duty. After a decade spent living by the sword, he seeks to bid a farewell to arms and make a new life with his friends as a musician.

Regardless of his faltering faith, the Phoenix Society has a final mission for Morgan after a dictator’s accusations make him a liability to the organization. He must put everything aside, travel to Boston, and prove he is not the Society’s assassin. He must put down Alexander Liebenthal’s coup while taking him alive.

Despite the gravity of his task, Morgan cannot put aside his ex-girlfriend’s murder, or efforts to frame him and his closest friends for the crime. He cannot ignore a request from a trusted friend to investigate the theft of designs for a weapon before which even gods stand defenseless. He cannot disregard the corruption implied in the Phoenix Society’s willingness to make him a scapegoat should he fail to resolve the crisis in Boston without bloodshed.

The words with which Morgan Stormrider forged his reputation haunt him still.
