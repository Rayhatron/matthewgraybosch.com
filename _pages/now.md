# Where I Am Now

I'm currently up to no good, as usual. I still work for Deloitte, but anything I post on my website or on social media is strictly my own opinion, and should not be taken to represent my employer.

I'm moving into a new house with my wife, and planning a vacation in Paris to celebrate her fortieth birthday.

I'm working with [my publisher](http://www.curiosityquills.com) to get my latest novel [*Silent Clarion*](/books/starbreaker/silent-clarion/) released in paperback. (The Kindle version dropped on 10/20/2016.)

I've started writing [*Blackened Phoenix*](/books/starbreaker/blackened-phoenix/), a sequel to [*Without Bloodshed*](/books/starbreaker/without-bloodshed/). It's going to take a while.

I've *also* started writing a novel called [*Dead Man's Hand*](/books/starbreaker/dead-mans-hand/), which is an origin story for Morgan Stormrider the way [*Silent Clarion*](/books/starbreaker/silent-clarion/) served as an introduction for Naomi Bradleigh. I might serialize this on my website and syndicate it to Medium.

I'm having fun with [*Let It Die*](https://letitdiethegame.com). It's some kind of ultraviolent rogue-like game with that trademark fucked up Suda51 style and a bitchin' J-Punk soundtrack.
